Here are the image related tests for my 2 PhD 7T - fMRI project 
Images test (python & matlab):
1. image similarity test (structural similarity index model):
   SSIM test folder: 1. imgrey.py : transfer colourful image to grey-scale
                      2. rename.py : rename the image file name if needed
                       3. msr_similiarity.py : SSIM image similiarity test (pixal lineup and density)
                         4. heatmap.py : plot results, store results in an array and calculate min max mean median values
2. image similiarity test (spatial envelope):
   Spatial envelop test: 1. similarity test.m : test gist similiarity and plot heat map.
    
3. image selection task (behavioural task to crop the familiar part from an image)
4. Match code: match the cropped image to the original image to check the position.
5. Brightness and contrast adjustment 
6. image crop code (e.g crop 1/4 lower right part of the image)
