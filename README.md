Here are the image related tests for my 2 PhD 7T - fMRI project 
Images test (python):
1. image similarity test (structural similarity index model)
2. Crop image (behavioural task to crop the familiar part from an image)
3. Match code: match the cropped image to the original image to check the position.
4. Plot code: plot the heatmap for the image similarity test
